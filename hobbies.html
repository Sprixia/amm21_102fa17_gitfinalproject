    <p class="hobvoldesc">
        For over four years I've worked regularly with a local shelter both as a volunteer at their
        actual facility, and as a foster by taking home animals in need of additional care. Pictured
        here on the left is Reggie, a three week old kitten who I had for six months until she was
        ready for adoption.

        <p class="hobvoldesc">
            The University of South Carolina Beaufort has accommodations available for students
            with disabilities. Access to notes is one of those accommodations, and I provided
            that for one of my classes during the Fall semester. I scanned and shared my notes
            from each class with students who had provided the proper documentation to USCB's
            disability services department.

    <p class="hobvoldesc">
        Read Across America is an annual event held on March 2nd that celebrates and promotes
        reading for children. Hundreds of schools across the country participate. The National
        Education Association and its sponsors provide support for the event, as well as year-round
        support for schools trying to promote reading for their students. For my part in this
        event last fall, I ran the sign-in and welcome center. I also provided the tickets that
        kids could exchange for free books.

    <p class="hobvoldesc">
        S.O.A.R. is an organization that focuses on providing year-round recreation activities
        for people with disabilities. They work with both children and adults. Every year, they
        organize the Special Olympics in our area and provide lunch, t-shirts, awards, photos,
        and an overall fun afternoon for all participants. I helped with general setup work
        last year.
