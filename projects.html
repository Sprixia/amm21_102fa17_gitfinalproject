    <h4>Resume Website</h4>
    <p class="proj">
        This is the website version of my resume, and is part of my portfolio. It was made using
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

    <h4>A Cherokee Celebration</h4>
    <p class="proj">
        This is a game where the player chooses their gender, then plays through a Native
        American ceremony. They need to help prepare by either collecting food (women) or
        hunting game animals (men). The game behaves differently and changes point awards
        based on the player's character selection. It was made using Java and Greenfoot.

    <h4>Heritage Library Foundation Website</h4>
    <p class="proj">
        The Heritage Library Foundation is a non-profit organization that provides resources
        for guests to explore their ancestry and learn more about local history in the Hilton
        Head region. They were previously using Textpattern for their website. It was not
        responsive to mobile phones or tablets and fairly out-of-date. I worked with the team
        assembled by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) chapter on campus, which I'm
        on the board for, to move the old website to a new and responsive content management
        system, SquareSpace. We used SquareSpace, Trello, and some minor custom HTML/CSS.
